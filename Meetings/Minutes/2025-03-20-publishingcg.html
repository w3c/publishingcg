<p id=00d2 class="phone s01"><cite>wolfgang:</cite> welcome to all</p>
<p id=cb30 class="phone s02"><cite>Nick:</cite> From Principles to Practice overview<br>

<span id=7580>… we act as a 'learning delivery network' sitting between learning providers and institutions/students/bookstores</span><br>
<span id=4563>… How do we do this?  1. Driving day 1 affordable access for millions.  2. Helping students stay engaged on Day 2 and beyond</span><br>
<span id=3b3d>… <a href="https://research.vitalsource.com/research">https://<wbr>research.vitalsource.com/<wbr>research</a> researching what works</span><br>

<span id=9d32>… one solution: VitalSource CoachMe.</span></p>
<p id=0770 class=summary>feature inside Bookshelf reader, adds AI generated low-stakes formative practice questions inside the textbook reading experience</p>
<p id=7712 class=summary>generated from the textbook, not a general LLM model</p>
<p id=b7a4 class=summary>instructors can assign engagement with these questions as a part of their grade</p>
<p id=1437 class=summary>uses VitalSource proprietary AI for automatic question generation.  Based on the Doer Effect from Carnegie Mellon OLI work</p>
<p id=6259 class=summary>'practice while reading causes 6x more learning gain than reading alone'</p>
<p id=4493 class=summary>bring active learning to a 'passive medium'</p>
<p id=4b75 class=summary>(deeper dive into how it works)</p>
<p id=9c8c class=summary>timeline of deployment and achievement</p>
<p id=38b8 class=summary>21 million AI generated questions answered in a learning context</p>
<p id=7e70 class=summary>published 35 peer reviewed papers</p>
<p id=79d8 class=summary>3 best paper awards</p>
<p id=ab45 class=summary>examination at Iowa State University course with A/B test with the same book, looking at how many times students opened their book showing dramatic improvement in engagement when CoachMe questions are assigned as a part of the grade</p>
<p id=abc4 class=summary>multiple school study showing increase in engagement by students<br>
<span id=df52>… 'but what about Gen AI?'</span></p>
<p id=0ce8 class=summary><a href="https://www.aacu.org/research/leading-through-disruption">https://<wbr>www.aacu.org/<wbr>research/<wbr>leading-through-disruption</a> discussed</p>
<p id=ac9a class=summary>explosion of GenAI usage</p>
<p id=2d79 class=summary>Key opportunities: things we can do for students and faculty that could not be done before</p>
<p id=1179 class=summary>Pro's and Con's of using AI</p>
<p id=3694 class=summary>The importance of responsible AI use:  <a href="https://get.vitalsource.com/ai-principles">https://<wbr>get.vitalsource.com/<wbr>ai-principles</a></p>
<p id=283f class=summary>referenced 1EdTech rubric <a href="https://www.1edtech.org/standards/ai-rubric">https://<wbr>www.1edtech.org/<wbr>standards/<wbr>ai-rubric</a></p>
<p id=9878 class=summary>Why do these principles matter?</p>
<p id=d9c3 class=summary>avoid &quot;AI for AI's sake', focus on real learning gains not hype, maintain strong publisher and institutional partnerships</p>
<p id=8b1c class=summary>where we are heading next...</p>
<p id=ffff class=summary>High quality AI answers aligned with textbook content, no model training, no IP leakage, SOC2 compliant use with LLMs, DRM protected</p>
<p id=f39e class=summary>Q&amp;A</p>
<p id=5157 class="phone s03"><cite>gautierchomel:</cite> when content/questions are generated, we need an evaluation methodology and a way to advise the user this is AI generated.  Have you been thinking about this?  Is it possible?</p>
<p id=d93c class="phone s04"><cite>uptownnickbrown:</cite> that concern drove a lot of our development and decisions.  'generation' is a misnomer, as nothing is 'generated'.  There is zero risk, as the sentence for the 'fill in the blank' is from the book.<br>
<span id=a1cc>… there are feedback mechanisms inside the book to give positive/negative feedback on the questions</span><br>
<span id=7c9b>… recommend: have clear disclaimers that this is AI generated content.  It's the right ethical thing to do.</span><br>
<span id=a01a>… measuring quality is also critical, and hard.</span><br>
<span id=8d0a>… automated judges that use LLMs to judge LLM responses, trained to do different tasks in different ways.  Judge a few different things at the same time (factually accurate, ...)</span><br>
<span id=6cb9>… reduce hallucinations by having the concrete source material</span><br>
<span id=7b79>… comfortable with a 'the book does not address that question' response</span><br>
<span id=bd6d>… also trying to evaluate the underlying pedagogy behind the model</span><br>
<span id=cc10>… 'can answer that... best I can do is recommend you read page 62 of the book' type of answers</span></p>
<p id=e8a6 class="phone s05"><cite>liisamk:</cite> have you thought about using AI for 'other things' with your reading system?</p>
<p id=84e2 class="phone s04"><cite>uptownnickbrown:</cite> a few ways to tie this into the reading system.  Things like making good flashcards (hard to do now).<br>
<span id=4b6d>… also looking at ways to evolve search beyond a 'find' function</span><br>
<span id=455d>… search with mixed languages...</span><br>
<span id=0ed6>… alt-text for screen readers</span><br>
<span id=dadf>… lots of places to pervade the reading system</span></p>
<p id=4fb2 class="phone s06"><cite>Michalis0:</cite> are questions created in real time, or pre-loaded?</p>
<p id=7225 class="phone s04"><cite>uptownnickbrown:</cite> yes, the CoachMe questions are pre-generated<br>
<span id=9654>… also aligned with where to ask the question in the book flow</span><br>
<span id=cf0e>… may evolve over time as AI improvements come</span><br>
<span id=8122>… over 1,000,000 questions in production at scale</span></p>
<p id=f518 class="phone s01"><cite>wolfgang:</cite> am I right that you mainly use NLP and not LLMs?</p>
<p id=6635 class="phone s04"><cite>uptownnickbrown:</cite> Yes.  That's exactly how we built CoachMe</p>
<p id=464d class="phone s01"><cite>wolfgang:</cite> did you take into account the AI legislation from the EU?</p>
<p id=7b76 class="phone s04"><cite>uptownnickbrown:</cite> we are starting to think more about that now, as it was not in place at the time.</p>
