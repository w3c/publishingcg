<h2>Meeting minutes</h2>
<section><p id=2f67 class="phone s01"><cite>gautier:</cite> Talk of Senthil (Ailaysa, Chennai) - we are taking notes</p>
<p id=3a82 class=irc><cite>&lt;gautierchomel&gt;</cite> presentmiia</p>
<p id=ffff class="phone s02"><cite>senthil:</cite> speak about the concept, then provide a demo, then Q &amp; A<br>
<span id=83ec>… Senthil Nathan from Ailaysa - AI company - content translation based on AI - taking content in different languages - international book fair in Chennai - introduced products into publsihing - before mainly translation/localization - automatic translations using AI</span><br>
<span id=c64c>… concepts: how to develop a responsible content in an AI context - we cannot have walled days - great data rush for training AI systems without knowledge and permission of owners - awareness that quality content is very important for AI - quality data should come from publishers, media companies, research institutes - shifting to being active</span></p>
<p id=6833 class=summary>negotiators<br>
<span id=bc8b>… Content exclusion of content as training data - in case of use responsible usage + permission needed - in 2024 ppl are actively discussing - should be a fair deal with proper compensation - illegal scraping was a big problem - is coming to an end - much more reduced now</span><br>
<span id=b2fb>… terms of permission are set by both parties - technical barriers can now be easily implemented - clear legal terms prohibiting use without limits - content watermarking and provenance tracking tools</span><br>
<span id=33ef>… to include: fair licensing terms - mandatory source citations in AI output - quality control: selective participation with responsible AI companies - usage tracking: monitoring how content influences AI responses - consent frameworks: granular control over AI uses</span><br>
<span id=e0a1>… factors: technical, business, regulatory and market dynamics</span><br>
<span id=c854>… AI-specific exclusion protocols (better than robots.txt) - rise of new AI-crawlers (require new blocking mechanisms) - dynamic paywalls and anti-scraping tech - emergence for content-tracking tools</span><br>
<span id=ac82>… blockers (NYT, Guardian) vs. partners (Axel Springer with OpenAI) vs. open access (But seeking attribution) vs. wait-and-see</span><br>
<span id=2910>… EU: Ai-Act - US: considering legal framework - courses of copyright offices</span><br>
<span id=b117>… market: growing need for high-quality content - AI is not thinking, algorithmic, not creative - publishers see new revenue streams via partnerships - data brokers like literary agency - syndication rights</span><br>
<span id=abad>… principle of fair monetization - important to track extent of usage and kinds of usage</span><br>
<span id=74c6>… from authoring to reading: AI environment is set - book discovery enhanced through LLM recommendation and search systems - going beyond metadata and keywords: asking questions on the contents of the book (e.g. ChaiReader)</span><br>
<span id=7028>… future options: read book in another language such as Tamil thx to automatic translation or as audiobook - in libraries, bookstores, schools use of books may be changed -</span><br>
<span id=7b6a>… HarperCollins works with MS, also Sage, CUP,</span><br>
<span id=d81c>… have to find common ground between publishers and AI companies</span></p>
<p id=10000 class=summary>Demo Chai Reader: Reading, Chatting and Buying in one portal - multilingual Q&amp;A - buy routine integrated - in future: book recommendations based on search terms - translation of a book into a target language</p>
<p id=ba98 class="phone s01"><cite>gautier:</cite> when I'm chatting with a book, answers only from book content - LLM only used to prepare a nice answer - not training each book in LLM -</p>
<p id=ae9a class="phone s02"><cite>Senthil:</cite> completely separated</p>
<p id=10001 class="phone s03"><cite>michalis:</cite> concerned that access to content should be fair use - esp. in the US -next months will be critical in legal aspects</p>
<p id=d3e4 class="phone s02"><cite>senthil:</cite> big publishers have great interest - different for small publishers or even authors -</p>
<p id=3482 class="phone s03"><cite>michalis:</cite> in education or academic this would be quite useful</p>
<p id=b23a class="phone s02"><cite>senthil:</cite> exactly useful to expolore several books in parallel to formulate an answer - we work with EDRLabs to improve on it - ChaiReader still in Beta - working with publishers - can chat with a collection of books, not only one at the same time - impact of &quot;AI on economics&quot; - reasoning capacity - more important than just referring back - great</p>
<p id=c10e class=summary>thing for book</p>
<p id=9f45 class=summary> discovery</p>
<p id=3411 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> aren't you forced to make some sort of ranking between books consumed - need a local ranking for books you have</p>
<p id=cec1 class="phone s02"><cite>senthil:</cite> possible to rank or categorize dependent on prompting</p>
<p id=9358 class="phone s05"><cite>vishal:</cite> the more correct the prompt, the more precise the answer will be - if 3 books have an answer - semantic ranking combined with keyword level ranking - still experimental feature - as Google and Amazon do</p>
<p id=7ff5 class="phone s04"><cite>ivan:</cite> in some cases this is not the best answer - in scholarly usage - ranking by systems outside your bookshop - based on reputation of answers - you use LLM only for niceties of input and output</p>
<p id=e49a class="phone s05"><cite>vishal:</cite> reinforcement learning - librarian knows the authors - deepseek uses this feature - integrate human expertise into machine</p>
<p id=8327 class="phone s02"><cite>senthil:</cite> good question</p>
<p id=fa7c class=irc><cite>&lt;gautierchomel&gt;</cite> RSSAgent make minutes</p>
