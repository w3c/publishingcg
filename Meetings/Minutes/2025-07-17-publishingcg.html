<h2>Meeting minutes</h2>
<section><p id=305c class="phone s01"><cite>Gautier:</cite>This session is part of a series with AI in RS.<br>
<span id=7805>… today Daniel Weck, lead developer of Thorium (reading system from EDRLab)</span></p>
<p id=ffff class="phone s02"><cite>DanielWeck:</cite> AI-generated content descriptions in Thorium - unreleased experiment, thus work in progress - lays foundations for user experience  we want to follow - demo two page spread with image of Jules Verne with description - inspect the HTML<br>
<span id=59eb>… image has empty @alt and empty title - lnik takes me to an appendix where the image is displayed - but here the @alt is not empty - it says &quot;linked image&quot;</span><br>
<span id=c816>… would be great if we hade some help from AI - Thorium has a zoom feature - leads to room for textual description - can choose an LLM to generate description -</span><br>
<span id=6128>… decide between &quot;short&quot; or &quot;extended&quot; description - I can edit the system prompt, but there is a default system prompt - Gemini very good at discovering ppl in images - extended description would have two paragraphs - advanced view of system prompt in JSON format - additional information in prompt in this format</span><br>
<span id=64df>… select text fron answer - run a search on the Internet to get more information</span><br>
<span id=10000>… new work from W3C WG - complex image (bar chart) - link to extended description - rich text that is not part of a short description - plan to create a modal interface where you might consult AI</span></p>
<p id=10001 class=summary>(1) user see descriptions (2) chat with AI (3) do further research on the web - familiar chat UI - modal interlay - default system prompt which sets useful boundaries - we also feed in metadata<br>
<span id=ec9e>… request short or extended descriptions easily - just &quot;one shot&quot; - we need to inform the user that an AI will hallucinate</span><br>
<span id=e641>… MCP Model Context Protocol for tool calls out of scope - RAG also not implemented - beyond basic embedding - also not local LLMs - response times OK, but not the quality - Gemini better for image descriptions</span><br>
<span id=9abb>… you may give metadata as embedded context for the prompt - advanced user may edit the systemprompt and might remove blatantly irrelevant metadata</span></p>
<p id=1a90 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> publishers are not happy with AI getting trained with their copyrighted materials. Any protections?</p>
<p id=8514 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> All conversations in the chat with AI, are used for training if I don't pay for using the LLM - If I were to pay for the service, the data remain private -always depends on the terms and conditions of a particular model - for publishers TDM reservation protocol allows to opt in or out - Thorium would respect this<br>
<span id=1b32>… , any ideas how that could be solved?</span></p>
<p id=1372 class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> if image is not used for training, publishers are OK with that.</p>
<p id=6781 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> Thorium would have to police the use of data by an LLM - Would Thorium have to blacklist some models?</p>
<p id=da0b class="phone s05"><cite>James:</cite> Publishers are very twitchy about copyrighted material - with an epub you can mark the TDM or place a couple of metatags - 6 or 7 different ways to signal that training ist not accepted - training is an issue -<br>
<span id=9d4a>… on-device LLMS would be helpful</span></p>
<p id=c756 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> Publishers don't want RS to create friction - with images copies and text scanning, it's so easy to be done (e.g. on a Mac) - we have to send the image to the AI, but can't control what the LLM wil be doing with it</p>
<p id=e01e class="phone s05"><cite>James:</cite> could a publisher embed a token ?</p>
<p id=b7d7 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> agreement with Mistral - access token for EDRLab - could run on a Thorium server - but Thorium doesn't transport the key itself- but uses it in accessing the LLM to answer users' requests</p>
<p id=10002 class="phone s06"><cite>Ori:</cite> if you using the user's API key, you can't know what the AI does with it - Gemini say they don't use it for training, no idea what OpenAI does - using another key is problematic<br>
<span id=3b16>… Gemini doesn't feed requests for image descriptions to humans</span></p>
<p id=b9e5 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> main stumbling block: potential of legal issues - we could enable it in nightly build, but not in production builds</p>
<p id=08ef class="phone s03"><cite>George:</cite> JPEG has metadata in it - is that transmitted?</p>
<p id=50cc class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> in FB Messenger or Signal I check that GPS data is erased before I share pictures - with AI once the image payload is transmitted - it will be readable for AI</p>
<p id=f141 class="phone s06"><cite>Ori:</cite> guess it will not ingest geographical data</p>
<p id=462d class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> most LLMs have restrictions - in Thorium we don't create requests for LLMs manually - we feed image data into an abstraction interface<br>
<span id=c7b6>… abstraction layer is fully client-side - it allows us to speak Javascript -</span></p>
<p id=2ae5 class="phone s06"><cite>Ori:</cite> had to reduce size of image - don't send EXIf or geographical data</p>
<p id=4b98 class="phone s04"><cite>Daniel:</cite> images processed before sending them on the wire - reduction in size before sending</p>
<p id=6f70 class="phone s01"><cite>gautier:</cite> WCAG criteria; description must offer same service as the image - a way to fulfil this - focus on authored description (if available) - real success for WCAG requirement</p>
