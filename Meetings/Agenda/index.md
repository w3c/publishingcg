# Agenda of the Plenary Sessions

* 2026 february 26th.  discussion on parallel content in EPUB, building on the [explainer "Parallel Content"](https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/blob/6a7cd78a8d5e5478d87b79dec40518a3790a410b/Incubation/parallel-content) and the GitHub [discussion "Ways to publish and consume parallel contents"](https://github.com/w3c/epub-specs/discussions/2829). The goal is to collect concrete use cases and requirements from content creators and implementers, and to discuss whether and how this work should evolve into a dedicated EPUB WG task force.

* 2026 January 29th: We will discuss what the [W3C Web Publications](https://w3c.github.io/wpub/) format is suitable for and explore its distinction from EPUB and other formats — in other words, under what conditions it is the best option. We would love to hear testimonies from professionals who are using or considering the use of the Web Publications format. Please come and join us!
