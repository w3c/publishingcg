The publishing community group is the place for innovation. We store here intermediate documents that supports the discussions and help keep information together all along the incubation process.

[W3C Guide on Incubation](https://www.w3.org/guide/incubation.html):

> Incubation is a way of exploring some new aspect of the Open Web Platform when the best way forward is unclear, when feasibility, compatibility, or developer interest is not yet established, or when early development would benefit from a wide variety of informed points of view before Standards-track work commences.

> It enables exploration of novel work, without overly diffusing the effort of a Working Group or expending a lot of resources on work that is ultimately abandoned.

> One possible result of incubation is the transfer of work to a Working Group, for Standards-track development. Work might also be forwarded to another group in liaison with W3C. Another possible result is the conclusion that this is a promising area of work, but that a number of prerequisites exist which should be solved first. Finally, incubators might conclude that no Standards-track work should be done in the area. This is still a valuable result, as it can reduce the effort expended on unfruitful option.
