# Publishing Community Group

## Introduction
This is the home repository for work done by the [W3C Publishing Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/publishingcg/) ([Github Page](https://w3c.github.io/publishingcg/)). The Publishing Community Group is the incubator community for [Publishing@W3C](https://www.w3.org/publishing/). The goal of the group is to propose, document, and prototype features broadly related to

- publications on the Web,
- reading modes and systems,
- the user experience of digital publications.

These topics are general and the community errs on the side of inclusive discussions; specifics are kept to dedicated [issues](https://github.com/w3c/publishingcg/issues). See [Ways to Contribute](#ways-to-contribute) if you'd like to participate but are unsure how.

For incubation of Web Platform features, visit the [Web Platform Incubator Community Group (WICG)](https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/).
